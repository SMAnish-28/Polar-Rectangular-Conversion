# Polar-Rectangular-Conversion

This Repo is for Conversion of Polar form to rectangular form and vice-versa.
In many calculators, there is already an inbuilt function for this conversion of Polar to Rectangular or Rectangular to Polar.

# Calculator Functions

- For _fx-991MS_, above ‘+’ & '-' there is a function of ‘r∠θ -> pol(' & 'a+bi -> rec(’ respectively
- For _fx-82MS_, there separate button for pol( and  rec(, near the ON button.

# Usage:

- For AC Circuit Analysis, Z = R + jX<sub>L</sub> or Z = R – jX<sub>C</sub> or Z = R + j(X<sub>L</sub> – X<sub>C</sub>), these are the complex rectangular form for circuit impedance which we have to convert into polar form to get its magnitude and phase angle at once, or sometimes polar forms to its rectangular forms, for calculation purposes.
